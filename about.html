<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a 6th-semester student in the AI & ML department at Coorg Institute of Technology. 
  Passionate about learning, I take various courses to expand my knowledge and stay updated in the field.
  In my free time, I enjoy watching anime like One Piece, Dragon Ball, Bleach, and Naruto, along with different series and movies. 
  I also help my parents whenever I can. Apart from academics, I love playing sports such as table tennis, badminton, and basketball, 
  keeping a balance between studies and physical activities.</p>
